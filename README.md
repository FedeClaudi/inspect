# pyinspect

If, like me, when coding often you *know* which function you need but can't quite remember 
its name, then I have **good news!**. `pyinspect` is here to help you out. 

`pyinspect` allows you to search for functions and class methods based on their name and 
prints out a handy table with all the functions that met your search criteria.
